# Lemmy Martin

A Lemmy client built in React Native.

This is a personal project to mess around with the Lemmy API and give myself a project to work on in my spare time that seemed fun. It is a work in progress and is missing various essential things you'd want in a client.

Until v1.0 is out, consider this repo very alpha and incomplete!

Feel free to view the [current board](https://github.com/users/aaronfg/projects/1/views/1) to see what I'm working on right now.
